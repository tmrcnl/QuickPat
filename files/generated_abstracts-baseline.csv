0,SYSTEM FOR CONNECTING IMPLEMENT TO MOBILE MACHINERY,"An apparatus for connecting an implement to a three point hitch of mobile machinery comprises two frameworks, a first framework and a second framework. The first framework is disposed in a first plane and comprises at least two parallel, vertically-spaced apart, laterally extending rails. There are three attachments supported by the first framework for attachment to the three-point hitch. The second framework is slidable generally in the plane of the first framework and is mounted on the rails to slide laterally along the rails. At least two connectors are supported by the slidable second framework for connecting the second framework to an implement that can be pulled or pushed by the mobile machinery. A driver is connected to the first framework and connected to the second framework for driving the second framework laterally back and forth along the rails of the first framework.","The invention relates to an apparatus designed to connect an implement to a three-point hitch of mobile machinery. The apparatus enables controllable side-shifting movement of the connected implement. This is achieved by a construction containing two main components, namely a first framework and a slidable second framework. The first framework, attached to the three-point hitch, has vertically spaced-apart rails, cross beams, and studs. The second framework, equipped with posts and sleeves, is capable of sliding along the rails of the first framework, thus achieving side-shifting movement. The operation of the second framework is driven by at least one driver, controlled by a guidance system. The result allows for precise lateral positioning of the connected implement, thus providing enhanced functional versatility in applications involving mobile machinery."
100,PEST CONTROL COMPOSITION,An insect control composition and related methods of preparation and use are disclosed. The composition includes a mixture of non-cannabis flour and an amount of cannabis seed flour effective to mitigate a population of insecta treated with the mixture.,"The present invention relates to a novel pesticide composition. Specifically, the composition is comprised of cannabis seed flour, non-cannabis seed flour, which is selected from the group that includes rice flour and wheat flour, along with a dried food product. The dried food product in this composition can be any of the following: cereal products, flour, cake mix, cornmeal, rice, pasta, crackers, cookies, dried beans, popcorn, nuts, chocolate, dried fruits, spices, tea, coffee, powdered milk, cured meat, pet food, birdseed, or any mixture of these. The thus formed composition provides an innovative and effective pesticide alternative."
1000,LAVAGE DEVICE,"A lavage device includes a housing unit, a power module, a transmission unit and an irrigation unit. The housing unit includes a housing body that defines a receiving space having an opening, and a cover that covers openably the opening. The power module is disposed in the receiving space, and is removable from the receiving space via the opening when the cover is opened. The power module includes a motor. The transmission unit includes a driven gear coupled to and driven rotatably by the motor, and a push member driven to reciprocate by the driven gear. The irrigating unit is connected to the transmission unit, and is adapted for drawing liquid through the reciprocate action of the push member and performing irrigation.","The patent is for a lavage device that includes a housing unit with a housing body and a cover. Inside the housing unit is a power module consisting of an outer shell, a motor with a main body, a rotary shaft, and a coupling member, a group of batteries and a circuit board. The device also features a transmission unit that includes a driven gear connected to the motor and a push member that is moved by the driven gear. The device has an irrigating unit connected to the transmission unit that draws liquid through the action of the push member and carries out irrigation. The power module can be removed from the housing unit when the cover is opened."
