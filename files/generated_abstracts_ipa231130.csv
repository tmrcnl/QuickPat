0,"SYSTEMS, APPARATUS, AND RELATED METHOD FOR REMOTE ADJUSTMENT OF MACHINERY","Systems, apparatus, and methods for remotely adjusting implements with preset profiles are described. A disclosed method for processing a material on a ground surface includes receiving a transmitted monitored set of parameters of the first set of material manipulators and the second set of material manipulators; determining whether the first set of material manipulators or the second set of material manipulators is within a predetermined range of a parameter setpoint; and upon determining the first set of material manipulators or the second set of material manipulators is not within the predetermined range of the parameter setpoint, actuating the first set of actuators to adjust the first set of material manipulators or the second set of actuators to adjust the second set of material manipulators, wherein actuating the first set of actuators or the second set of actuators can be performed independently.","The described system pertains to the manipulation of material on a ground surface. This system comprises an implement with two sets of material manipulators, both capable of adjusting and manipulating material independently of each other. Each manipulator set is monitored by its respective sensor set and can be adjusted by its corresponding set of actuators. The system is further integrated with a device installed within a vehicle, linked to the implement and the various sensors and actuators. The device, equipped with processing circuitry, receives monitored parameters from the implement, verifies if the manipulators are operating within predetermined parameters, and if not, actuates the corresponding set of actuators to make necessary adjustments. The system achieves independent actuation of the manipulator sets."
100,APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR EX VIVO LUNG VENTILATION WITH A VARYING EXTERIOR PRESSURE,"In a method of ventilating excised lungs, a ventilation gas is supplied to an airway of a lung and a vacuum is formed around the lung. A quality of the vacuum is varied between a lower level and a higher level to cause the lung to breathe, while the pressure of the ventilation gas supplied to the airway is regulated to maintain a positive airway pressure in the airway of the lung. The vacuum may be cyclically varied between the two vacuum levels. The levels may be maintained substantially constant over a period of time, or one or both of the lower and higher levels may be adjusted during ventilation. The lung may be placed in a sealed chamber, and a vacuum is formed in the chamber around the lung.","The system for lung ventilation includes a gas pump with an exhaust side and an intake side, a sealed chamber, and an array of conduits and valves. The sealed chamber encloses the lung and applies differing pressures to its airway and exterior surface. The conduits and valves link the gas pump to the chamber in order to selectively manage these pressures. The valves contain three proportional valves connected to various parts of the gas pump, and the conduits involve connections between these valves, the chamber, and the lung airway. Through control of these valves, the pressures applied to the lung's exterior surface and airway can be independently regulated."
1000,THERAPEUTIC DERIVATIVES OF INTERLEUKIN-22,"The invention relates to novel derivatives of Interleukin-22 (IL-22), particularly those comprising a fatty acid covalently attached to an IL-22 protein, and their use in therapy.","The method described involves the treatment of a disease, disorder, or condition in subjects by administering a derivative of IL-22. This derivative consists of a fatty acid covalently bonded to an IL-22 protein. The IL-22 protein can either be native mature human IL-22 (hIL-22; SEQ ID NO. 1) or a variant. The variation of the protein either lies within SEQ ID NO. 1 and has a minimum of 10% sequence identity with hIL-22 or is a variant relative to SEQ ID NO. 1. The fatty acid is covalently attached to a Cys residue within the IL-22 protein."
2000,Systems and Methods for Securing License Plates,"Improved systems and methods for securing license plates are disclosed herein. In the preferred embodiments discussed, the systems and methods are applied to the securing of dealer license plates. There are numerous problems with the unauthorized or illegal use of these types of license plates, and the machine and software combination disclosed herein may provide solutions to at least some of these problems.","The abstract discloses a tracking device designed for license plates. The device includes a global positioning system (GPS) tracker nested within an electronic housing. The electronic housing is specially created to enable attachment to a license plate. Therefore, the location of the license plate, and implicitly of the vehicle, can be monitored and tracked, providing continual geo-location information. This device seamlessly integrates into the vehicle's existing infrastructure without major modifications, maintaining its original look and feel."
5001,METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INTELLIGENT MAINTENANCE SERVICES USING MACHINE LEARNING,"A method for intelligent maintenance services using machine learning involves obtaining maintenance tickets associated with an industrial operation. The maintenance tickets include unstructured text. The method further involves, for each of the maintenance tickets, performing, by one or more computer processors, a natural language processing of the unstructured text to extract features, and generating, by the computer processor, a topic model for the maintenance tickets, based on the features. The topic model represents each of the maintenance tickets by a collection of topics. The method also involves applying the topic model to obtain maintenance insights for the industrial operation.","The abstract presents a method involving the extraction of features from maintenance tickets associated with an industrial operation. These tickets include unstructured text that is processed using a computer-based natural language processing. A topic model is created for every maintenance ticket, each represented by a group of topics derived from the features. The topic model is then utilized to yield maintenance insights applied towards the involved industrial operation."
