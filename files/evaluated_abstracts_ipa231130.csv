0,"SYSTEMS, APPARATUS, AND RELATED METHOD FOR REMOTE ADJUSTMENT OF MACHINERY","Systems, apparatus, and methods for remotely adjusting implements with preset profiles are described. A disclosed method for processing a material on a ground surface includes receiving a transmitted monitored set of parameters of the first set of material manipulators and the second set of material manipulators; determining whether the first set of material manipulators or the second set of material manipulators is within a predetermined range of a parameter setpoint; and upon determining the first set of material manipulators or the second set of material manipulators is not within the predetermined range of the parameter setpoint, actuating the first set of actuators to adjust the first set of material manipulators or the second set of actuators to adjust the second set of material manipulators, wherein actuating the first set of actuators or the second set of actuators can be performed independently.","A system designed for the manipulation of material on a ground surface includes an implement that features a dual set of material manipulators, each independently adjustable, coupled with corresponding sensors and actuators. The sensors are tasked with monitoring various operational parameters while the actuators are responsible for making adjustments to the manipulators. A vehicle-mounted device, which is both mechanically and electrically connected to the implement, facilitates communication. This device receives data from the sensors and processes it to ascertain whether the manipulators are operating within a specified parameter range. Should any manipulator fall outside this range, the device independently actuates the necessary adjustments via the appropriate set of actuators to bring performance back in line with the set parameter specifications.",0.7795658707618713,6.665994167327881,4
1,APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR EX VIVO LUNG VENTILATION WITH A VARYING EXTERIOR PRESSURE,"In a method of ventilating excised lungs, a ventilation gas is supplied to an airway of a lung and a vacuum is formed around the lung. A quality of the vacuum is varied between a lower level and a higher level to cause the lung to breathe, while the pressure of the ventilation gas supplied to the airway is regulated to maintain a positive airway pressure in the airway of the lung. The vacuum may be cyclically varied between the two vacuum levels. The levels may be maintained substantially constant over a period of time, or one or both of the lower and higher levels may be adjusted during ventilation. The lung may be placed in a sealed chamber, and a vacuum is formed in the chamber around the lung.","A system designed for the ventilation of a lung includes a gas pump with an exhaust side and an intake side, along with a sealed chamber configured to enclose the lung. The chamber is designed to apply two different pressures, one to the airway of the lung and another to the exterior surface of the lung. Various conduits and valves connect the gas pump to the chamber to regulate these pressures independently. The system features a first, second, and third proportional valve, each connected to different sides of the gas pump or to each other. These valves are arranged to work in conjunction with conduits that extend through the sealed chamber and connect the lung's airway to the gas pump, effectively supplying the desired pressure to both the airway and the external surface of the lung. The pressures are independently adjustable through precise control of the three proportional valves.",0.7276119589805603,7.295848846435547,4
2,THERAPEUTIC DERIVATIVES OF INTERLEUKIN-22,"The invention relates to novel derivatives of Interleukin-22 (IL-22), particularly those comprising a fatty acid covalently attached to an IL-22 protein, and their use in therapy.","A method is provided for treating diseases, disorders, or conditions. This method involves administering a specific derivative of IL-22 to a subject in need of such treatment. The IL-22 derivative is characterized by having a fatty acid that is covalently linked to the IL-22 protein. The IL-22 protein can either be the native mature human IL-22, as defined by a specified sequence, or a variant of this protein. Variants of the IL-22 protein retain a significant degree of sequence identity to the specified human IL-22 and may include alterations within this sequence. The fatty acid is specifically attached to a cysteine (Cys) residue found within the IL-22 protein structure.",0.6762346625328064,5.557382583618164,3
3,Systems and Methods for Securing License Plates,"Improved systems and methods for securing license plates are disclosed herein. In the preferred embodiments discussed, the systems and methods are applied to the securing of dealer license plates. There are numerous problems with the unauthorized or illegal use of these types of license plates, and the machine and software combination disclosed herein may provide solutions to at least some of these problems.",The present disclosure relates to a tracking device specifically designed for attachment to license plates. It includes a global positioning system (GPS) tracker housed within an electronic enclosure. The electronic enclosure is configured in such a way that it can be effectively and securely attached to a license plate. This allows for the real-time location tracking of the vehicle to which the license plate is affixed.,0.6076164841651917,5.556775093078613,3
4,METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INTELLIGENT MAINTENANCE SERVICES USING MACHINE LEARNING,"A method for intelligent maintenance services using machine learning involves obtaining maintenance tickets associated with an industrial operation. The maintenance tickets include unstructured text. The method further involves, for each of the maintenance tickets, performing, by one or more computer processors, a natural language processing of the unstructured text to extract features, and generating, by the computer processor, a topic model for the maintenance tickets, based on the features. The topic model represents each of the maintenance tickets by a collection of topics. The method also involves applying the topic model to obtain maintenance insights for the industrial operation.","A method includes the steps of acquiring maintenance tickets related to an industrial process, which contain unstructured text. Using one or more computer processors, the method involves analyzing the unstructured text of each maintenance ticket to identify specific characteristics through natural language processing. Subsequently, a computer processor is used to create a topic model for these maintenance tickets, utilizing the extracted features. This model assigns a set of topics to each ticket. Finally, this model is employed to deduce maintenance insights that pertain to the industrial process, facilitating an organized understanding and management of the maintenance aspects of operations.",0.8052397966384888,7.323786735534668,4
