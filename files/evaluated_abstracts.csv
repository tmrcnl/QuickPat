0,SYSTEM FOR CONNECTING IMPLEMENT TO MOBILE MACHINERY,"An apparatus for connecting an implement to a three point hitch of mobile machinery comprises two frameworks, a first framework and a second framework. The first framework is disposed in a first plane and comprises at least two parallel, vertically-spaced apart, laterally extending rails. There are three attachments supported by the first framework for attachment to the three-point hitch. The second framework is slidable generally in the plane of the first framework and is mounted on the rails to slide laterally along the rails. At least two connectors are supported by the slidable second framework for connecting the second framework to an implement that can be pulled or pushed by the mobile machinery. A driver is connected to the first framework and connected to the second framework for driving the second framework laterally back and forth along the rails of the first framework.","The abstract describes an apparatus designed for the connection of an implement to the THREE-point hitch of mobile machinery, enabling side-shifting movement of the connected implement. The apparatus includes a first framework with specific elements like parallel rails, an upper and lower cross beam, and at least two upwardly extending studs. It also features three attachments connected to the first framework which fastens to the THREE-point hitch. The apparatus also contains a second framework that can slide laterally along the rails of the first framework. Also included are three connectors, at least one driver, and a guidance system. The connectors link the slidable second framework and the implement, while the driver assists the movement of the second framework along the rails. The guidance system controls the driver.",0.8905011415481567,8.569369316101074,4.5
1,PEST CONTROL COMPOSITION,An insect control composition and related methods of preparation and use are disclosed. The composition includes a mixture of non-cannabis flour and an amount of cannabis seed flour effective to mitigate a population of insecta treated with the mixture.,"This abstract is focused on a pesticide composition formulated by using a unique blend of ingredients. The chief component is cannabis seed flour mixed with a variant of non-cannabis seed flour, which can be derived either from rice or wheat. This is then combined with a dried food product, allowing a broad range of selection including but not limited to cereal products, cake mix, cornmeal, pasta, tea, powdered milk, and even pet food, among other options. This unique pesticide composition is essentially established through this combination of elements.",0.6295352578163147,6.069368362426758,4.0
2,LAVAGE DEVICE,"A lavage device includes a housing unit, a power module, a transmission unit and an irrigation unit. The housing unit includes a housing body that defines a receiving space having an opening, and a cover that covers openably the opening. The power module is disposed in the receiving space, and is removable from the receiving space via the opening when the cover is opened. The power module includes a motor. The transmission unit includes a driven gear coupled to and driven rotatably by the motor, and a push member driven to reciprocate by the driven gear. The irrigating unit is connected to the transmission unit, and is adapted for drawing liquid through the reciprocate action of the push member and performing irrigation.","This abstract describes a lavage device constructed with a removable power module contained within a housing unit. The power module has a motor connected to a group of batteries and controlled by a circuit board. This motor contains a rotary shaft that extends outwardly via a shaft hole. This shaft is connected to a coupling member outside of the shell. A transmission unit involves a gear, which is driven by the motor, and a push member. The gear's rotation drives the push member to reciprocate. An irrigation unit is then connected to this transmission unit. The reciprocating action of the push member enables the irrigation unit to draw in liquid and perform irrigation.",0.8688110709190369,8.032154083251953,4.0
3,"Cabin Arrangement For An Aircraft, And Aircraft","A cabin arrangement for an aircraft, includes a galley monument, which has at least one projection surface, and a projector device by which graphical information can be projected onto the at least one projection surface. Furthermore, an aircraft is described which has at least one such cabin arrangement with the galley monument.","The abstract covers a cabin arrangement for an aircraft. The arrangement features a galley monument that includes a minimum of one projection surface. The cabin arrangement also includes a projector device. The hardware of the projector device is designed in a manner that allows it to project graphical information onto the aforementioned projection surface. This set-up can be found in aircrafts, enhancing the onboard experience. The information that can be projected ranges across various categories, all of them being of a graphical nature.",0.8219096660614014,8.204303741455078,4.0
4,METHODS OF MAKING AND USING AN IDENTIFICATION TAG SYSTEM FOR USE WITH AN ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY CABLE,"A system for identifying which electromagnetic energy cable outlets are connected to a particular source of electromagnetic energy, including an electromagnetic energy cable outlet faceplate cover having at least one electromagnetic energy cable outlet opening such that the electromagnetic energy cable outlet faceplate cover is located over an electromagnetic energy cable outlet connector, an electromagnetic energy cable operatively connected to at least one source of electromagnetic energy and the electromagnetic energy cable outlet connector; and a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag attached to, embedded within, or located adjacent to the back side of the electromagnetic energy cable outlet faceplate cover, such that the radio frequency identification tag contains information related to which of the at least one source of electromagnetic energy is connected to the electromagnetic energy cable outlet.","The subject matter is a system for identifying the connection between electromagnetic energy cable outlets and their source of electromagnetic energy. This system includes an outlet faceplate cover equipped with one or more openings and a fastener, placed over an outlet connector. An electromagnetic energy cable, with its first end connected to a selected source of energy from multiple sources, and the second end linked to the outlet connector, is also included. A significant component of the system is a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag positioned on the faceplate cover's front side, carrying vital information about which source of electromagnetic energy is connected to the outlet.",0.750766396522522,7.058605194091797,4.0
