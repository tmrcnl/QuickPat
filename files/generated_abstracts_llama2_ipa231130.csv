0,"SYSTEMS, APPARATUS, AND RELATED METHOD FOR REMOTE ADJUSTMENT OF MACHINERY","Systems, apparatus, and methods for remotely adjusting implements with preset profiles are described. A disclosed method for processing a material on a ground surface includes receiving a transmitted monitored set of parameters of the first set of material manipulators and the second set of material manipulators; determining whether the first set of material manipulators or the second set of material manipulators is within a predetermined range of a parameter setpoint; and upon determining the first set of material manipulators or the second set of material manipulators is not within the predetermined range of the parameter setpoint, actuating the first set of actuators to adjust the first set of material manipulators or the second set of actuators to adjust the second set of material manipulators, wherein actuating the first set of actuators or the second set of actuators can be performed independently.","A system for manipulating material on a ground surface is disclosed, comprising an implement with multiple material manipulators that can be independently adjusted. The system includes sensors to monitor parameters of the manipulators and actuators to adjust the manipulators based on the monitored parameters. A first device, disposed in a vehicle, is communicatively coupled to the sensors, actuators, and manipulators, and processes the monitored parameters to determine if the manipulators are within a predetermined range of a parameter setpoint. If the manipulators are not within the predetermined range, the first device actuates the appropriate actuators to adjust the manipulators to the setpoint. The system allows for independent adjustment of the manipulators by the first and second sets of actuators."
100,APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR EX VIVO LUNG VENTILATION WITH A VARYING EXTERIOR PRESSURE,"In a method of ventilating excised lungs, a ventilation gas is supplied to an airway of a lung and a vacuum is formed around the lung. A quality of the vacuum is varied between a lower level and a higher level to cause the lung to breathe, while the pressure of the ventilation gas supplied to the airway is regulated to maintain a positive airway pressure in the airway of the lung. The vacuum may be cyclically varied between the two vacuum levels. The levels may be maintained substantially constant over a period of time, or one or both of the lower and higher levels may be adjusted during ventilation. The lung may be placed in a sealed chamber, and a vacuum is formed in the chamber around the lung.","The present invention relates to a ventilation system for a lung, which comprises a gas pump, a sealed chamber, and a plurality of conduits and valves. The gas pump applies pressures (P1 and P2) to the lung and its exterior surface through the chamber and conduits. The proportional valves in the system regulate P1 and P2 independently by controlling the flow of gas through the conduits. The invention allows for precise control of P1 and P2, which can improve lung function and reduce the risk of complications."
1000,THERAPEUTIC DERIVATIVES OF INTERLEUKIN-22,"The invention relates to novel derivatives of Interleukin-22 (IL-22), particularly those comprising a fatty acid covalently attached to an IL-22 protein, and their use in therapy.","The present invention relates to a method of treating a disease or condition in a subject by administering a derivative of interleukin-22 (IL-22). The derivative consists of an IL-22 protein covalently attached to a fatty acid. The IL-22 protein is either native mature human IL-22 or a variant with at least 10% sequence identity to hIL-22. The fatty acid is attached to a cysteine residue in the IL-22 protein. This method has shown promise in treating various diseases and conditions, including inflammatory disorders and cancer."
2000,Systems and Methods for Securing License Plates,"Improved systems and methods for securing license plates are disclosed herein. In the preferred embodiments discussed, the systems and methods are applied to the securing of dealer license plates. There are numerous problems with the unauthorized or illegal use of these types of license plates, and the machine and software combination disclosed herein may provide solutions to at least some of these problems.","The present invention relates to a tracking device for license plates, which comprises a global positioning system (GPS) tracker integrated within an electronic housing. The electronic housing is designed to securely attach to a license plate, allowing for the device to track the location of the vehicle to which it is attached. This invention provides a convenient and efficient means of tracking the location of vehicles, which can be useful in a variety of applications, such as fleet management or vehicle recovery."
5001,METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INTELLIGENT MAINTENANCE SERVICES USING MACHINE LEARNING,"A method for intelligent maintenance services using machine learning involves obtaining maintenance tickets associated with an industrial operation. The maintenance tickets include unstructured text. The method further involves, for each of the maintenance tickets, performing, by one or more computer processors, a natural language processing of the unstructured text to extract features, and generating, by the computer processor, a topic model for the maintenance tickets, based on the features. The topic model represents each of the maintenance tickets by a collection of topics. The method also involves applying the topic model to obtain maintenance insights for the industrial operation.","This invention relates to a method for analyzing maintenance tickets associated with an industrial operation. The method involves using natural language processing techniques to extract features from unstructured text in the maintenance tickets. These features are then used to generate a topic model, which represents each maintenance ticket as a collection of topics. The topic model is applied to obtain insights for the industrial operation, such as identifying patterns or trends in the maintenance tickets. This approach can help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance operations by providing valuable insights that can inform decision-making."
