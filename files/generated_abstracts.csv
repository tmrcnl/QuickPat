0,SYSTEM FOR CONNECTING IMPLEMENT TO MOBILE MACHINERY,"An apparatus for connecting an implement to a three point hitch of mobile machinery comprises two frameworks, a first framework and a second framework. The first framework is disposed in a first plane and comprises at least two parallel, vertically-spaced apart, laterally extending rails. There are three attachments supported by the first framework for attachment to the three-point hitch. The second framework is slidable generally in the plane of the first framework and is mounted on the rails to slide laterally along the rails. At least two connectors are supported by the slidable second framework for connecting the second framework to an implement that can be pulled or pushed by the mobile machinery. A driver is connected to the first framework and connected to the second framework for driving the second framework laterally back and forth along the rails of the first framework.","An apparatus is designed to facilitate side-shifting movement of an implement attached to a mobile machine's three-point hitch, which includes an upper attachment point and two lower attachment points. The apparatus consists of a first framework with laterally extending rails, an upper and a lower cross beam, and vertical studs aligned in the framework's plane. It incorporates three attachments for connecting to the hitch points. A second framework, capable of sliding along the rails, has vertical posts and sleeves, with three connectors to link the implement for lateral movement. Included in the design is at least one driver for shifting the second framework along the rails and a guidance system to control the movement. This construction allows the implement to slide side-to-side relative to the machine's three-point hitch."
100,PEST CONTROL COMPOSITION,An insect control composition and related methods of preparation and use are disclosed. The composition includes a mixture of non-cannabis flour and an amount of cannabis seed flour effective to mitigate a population of insecta treated with the mixture.,"The disclosure relates to a pesticide composition that primarily comprises a blend of cannabis seed flour and non-cannabis seed flour, with the latter selected from alternatives such as rice flour and wheat flour. Additionally, the composition includes a variety of dried food products. The scope of suitable dried food products encompasses a diverse range of edibles and food-related items, including, but not limited to, cereal products, various flour types, cake mix, cornmeal, assorted grains like rice and pasta, snack items like crackers, cookies, and popcorn, as well as nuts, chocolate, an array of dried fruits, and various seasoning items such as spices, tea, and coffee. The composition also extends to incorporating powdered milk, cured meats, and several pet and animal feed products, such as pet food and birdseed. These components are combined in such a way to create the pesticide composition."
1000,LAVAGE DEVICE,"A lavage device includes a housing unit, a power module, a transmission unit and an irrigation unit. The housing unit includes a housing body that defines a receiving space having an opening, and a cover that covers openably the opening. The power module is disposed in the receiving space, and is removable from the receiving space via the opening when the cover is opened. The power module includes a motor. The transmission unit includes a driven gear coupled to and driven rotatably by the motor, and a push member driven to reciprocate by the driven gear. The irrigating unit is connected to the transmission unit, and is adapted for drawing liquid through the reciprocate action of the push member and performing irrigation.","The described technology relates to a lavage device, which includes a housing unit equipped with a body that forms a space with an opening and a cover that can openably seal this opening. Within the housing unit resides a power module that is capable of being removed through the opening when the cover is opened. The power module encompasses an outer shell with a shaft hole, a motor with a rotary shaft that extends through the shaft hole and is connected to a coupling member externally, as well as batteries and a circuit board both housed within the shell and connected to the motor. Additionally, the device features a transmission unit consisting of a driven gear that engages with the motor's coupling member and a push member that is moved by the rotation of the driven gear. Finally, an irrigating unit is attached to this transmission unit and is responsible for drawing in liquid through the motion of the push member to facilitate irrigation."
2000,"Cabin Arrangement For An Aircraft, And Aircraft","A cabin arrangement for an aircraft, includes a galley monument, which has at least one projection surface, and a projector device by which graphical information can be projected onto the at least one projection surface. Furthermore, an aircraft is described which has at least one such cabin arrangement with the galley monument.","The described cabin arrangement for an aircraft includes a galley monument equipped with at least one projection surface. Additionally, it encompasses a projector device that is specifically designed to cast graphical information onto the projection surface(s) integrated within the galley monument. This arrangement allows for the display of visual content within the cabin space of the aircraft."
5000,AUTOMATED PHYSICAL NETWORK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM UTILIZING HIGH RESOLUTION RFID AND OPTICAL SCANNING FOR RFID TAG SPATIAL LOCALIZATION,"Apparatus and methods automatically track the physical connection configuration of fiber optic cables using high spatial resolution RFID tag readout and high-resolution optical scanning In further embodiments, the acquisition of s RFID and/or optical scans are performed by a robotic scanning system.","A method and system for facilitating secure multi-factor authentication using a dynamic and temporary QR code are presented. Upon a user's request for access to a secure resource, a server generates a unique QR code that encapsulates a transaction identifier and a temporary and dynamic nature, which is displayed to the user. The user scans the QR code with a registered mobile device, which transmits the transaction identifier to the server. The server, in turn, confirms the legitimacy of the identifier and grants access to the secure resource upon successful validation of the user's credentials. The process ensures additional security by incorporating a temporary validity period for the QR code, which expires upon usage or after a predetermined time, warranting that the code cannot be reused or exploited after its intended session. The system streamlines authentication while maintaining robust security measures for transactions involving sensitive data or services."
